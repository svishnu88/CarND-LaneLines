** Goals of the project ** To identify lanes in front of the car camera.

**Pipeline for identifying lanes**

    * Build a pipeline which takes in an image taken from the car and finds where the lane lines are.
    * The pipeline contains the following building parts. 
        1. Convert color image to a gray scale image.

        2. Reduce the noise and image detail using Gaussian blur.
        3. Apply a canny edge detector to identify edges from the blurred gray image.

        4. Apply a polygon mask , so that only the lanes in the front of the camera are detected.
        5. Use a Hough transform to detect , the points that form lines based on several arguments like rho , theta , threshold inside the masked area , such that only lanes in front of the camera are detected.

        6. Based on the various lines generated by hough transform , seperate lines with a positive slope slightly greater than 0.1 for right line and seperate lines with a negative slope slightly lesser than 0.1 for the left line.Once the lines are segregated based on slopes , I used np.polyfit to find slope and bias of a line that pass through the different points for the left and right lines.Fit a line using 'cv2.line'.

## Potential shortcomings:
* The masking was done using a rough estimate of its coordinates. Which could fail drastically when a different resolution photos are used. 
* The pipeline may fail to work when there is a long turning where lane lines look like curves.

## Possible improvements : 
* We can use a CNN to detect lanes , by creating labelled data. 
* Avoid hard coding values of the polygon image.
